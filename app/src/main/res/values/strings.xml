    <string name="scrollbar_3_text">The Android platform is a software stack for mobile devices including an operating
        system, middleware and key applications. Developers can create applications for the platform using the Android
        SDK. Applications are written using the Java programming language and run on Dalvik, a custom virtual machine
        designed for embedded use which runs on top of a Linux kernel. If you want to know how to develop applications
        for Android, you\\\'re in the right place. This site provides a variety of documentation that will help you
        learn about Android and develop mobile applications for the platform. An early look at the the Android SDK is
        also available. It includes sample projects with source code, development tools, an emulator, and of course all
        the libraries you\\\'ll need to build an Android application. What would it take to build a better mobile phone?
